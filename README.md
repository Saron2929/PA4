Manager Code
It provides an  interface for inputting data about managers, including their names, hourly wages, hours worked, and bonuses. Once the information is entered, the program calculates the highest-paid manager and the average pay across all managers, allowing users to quickly identify key insights into their managerial team's compensation.
For the highest-paid manager calculation, Manager Code iterates through the provided manager data, comparing each manager's calculated pay (based on their hourly wage, hours worked, and bonus) to determine the manager with the highest earnings. This process allows users to swiftly identify which manager earns the most within the given dataset.
Regarding the average pay calculation, Manager Code aggregates the total pay of all managers by summing up their individual earnings. It then divides this total by the number of managers to compute the average pay. This feature provides users with valuable insights into the overall compensation level across their managerial team, aiding in budgeting and decision-making processes
